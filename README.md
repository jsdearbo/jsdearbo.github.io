# Jake Dearborn

Welcome to my professional site. I'm a PhD candidate in Molecular Biology at the University of Vermont with a strong foundation in **computational genomics**, **machine learning**, and **immune transcriptomics**. My research integrates statistical modeling and deep learning to study gene regulation, with a focus on splicing and immune signaling pathways. I'm currently seeking industry opportunities in **biotechnology** or **computational biology** (starting 2026).
