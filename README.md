# Jake Dearborn

Welcome! I'm a molecular biologist and computational scientist currently working at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), where I apply integrative single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches to study gene regulation in development and disease.

My research combines **high-throughput genomics**, **data-driven discovery**, and **machine learning** to understand how cellular context shapes gene expression. I'm particularly interested in regulatory variation, immune signaling, and spatial organization in tissue microenvironments.
