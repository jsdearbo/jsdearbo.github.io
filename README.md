# Jake Dearborn, PhD Candidate  
**Computational Genomics · Machine Learning · RNA Biology**

Welcome. I am a late-stage PhD candidate in **Molecular Biology** at the **University of Vermont (Larner College of Medicine)** working at the intersection of **regulatory genomics, RNA biology, and deep learning**. My research focuses on decoding **cell-type–specific alternative splicing programs** and **splicing kinetics** in immune cells using large-scale sequencing data and foundation-model–based approaches.

I am actively preparing for **industry roles in computational genomics, machine learning for biology, and regulatory sequence modeling** beginning in 2026.

## Research Focus

My work combines experimental RNA biology with modern machine learning to understand how sequence encodes regulatory function, with an emphasis on:

- **Programmed delayed splicing** and intron retention dynamics in inflammatory gene programs (NF-κB transcriptome)  
- **Immune cell type–specific alternative splicing regulation** (B cells, T cells, macrophages)  
- **Cis-regulatory motif discovery** in introns and exons using deep learning and attribution methods  
- **Fine-tuning and interpreting foundation models** (e.g. Borzoi) for splicing and RNA processing tasks  
- **Sequence-to-function modeling** for therapeutic target discovery  

This work forms the basis of my dissertation:  
**“Programmed Delayed Splicing and Immune Cell Type–Specific Alternative Splicing.”**
