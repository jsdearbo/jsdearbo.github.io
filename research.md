# Research

My research integrates **RNA biology, regulatory genomics, and deep learning** to understand how sequence encodes splicing regulation and how alternative splicing programs differ across immune cell types.

The unifying goal of my work is to move beyond descriptive splicing catalogs toward **mechanistic, sequence-resolved models** of splicing regulation that are interpretable and therapeutically relevant.

## Programmed Delayed Splicing in Inflammatory Gene Regulation

This first-author project focuses on defining and characterizing **intron-specific splicing delays** across the NF-κB–responsive transcriptome.

Key components:

- Quantification of splicing completion using **Completed Splicing Index (CoSI)**  
- Kinetic RNA-seq to measure intron excision dynamics following inflammatory stimulation  
- Identification of **bottleneck introns** with reproducible, delayed splicing behavior  
- Integration with regulatory sequence features and splice site strength  

This work demonstrates that delayed splicing is **programmed and intron-specific**, rather than stochastic, and contributes to temporal regulation of inflammatory gene expression.

## Immune Cell Type–Specific Alternative Splicing Programs

A major focus of my current work is decoding how **B cells, T cells, and macrophages** deploy distinct alternative splicing programs despite sharing the same genome.

This includes:

- Construction of **cell-type–specific transcript annotations** from RNA-seq using StringTie  
- PSI and intron retention quantification across immune lineages  
- Deep learning–based modeling of exon inclusion and intron retention  
- Discovery of **cis-regulatory motifs** enriched in lineage-specific splicing events  

The goal is to define **regulatory programs**, not just individual events, that distinguish immune cell identities.

## Foundation Model Fine-Tuning for Splicing Prediction

I am actively fine-tuning and interpreting foundation models (e.g. **Borzoi**) for splicing-related tasks, including:

- PSI and intron retention prediction  
- Cell-type–specific splicing behavior  
- Attribution-driven motif discovery  
- In silico mutagenesis and motif ablation  

This work combines **LoRA/PEFT fine-tuning**, mixed-precision training, and large-scale attribution to extract biologically meaningful regulatory signals from deep models.

## Regulatory Motif Discovery & Interpretation

Across projects, I apply:

- **DeepLIFT / DeepSHAP / Captum** for feature attribution  
- **TF-MoDISco** for motif discovery  
- MEME, FIMO, and tangermeme for motif scanning and validation  

These approaches are used to identify candidate **RNA-binding protein motifs** and novel intronic regulatory elements controlling splicing kinetics and exon choice.
