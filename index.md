# Jake Dearborn, PhD Candidate  
**Computational Genomics · Machine Learning · RNA Biology**

I am a late-stage PhD candidate in **Molecular Biology** at the **University of Vermont (Larner College of Medicine)** working at the intersection of **regulatory genomics, RNA biology, and deep learning**. My research focuses on decoding **cell-type–specific alternative splicing programs** and **splicing kinetics** in immune cells using large-scale sequencing data and foundation-model–based approaches.

I am actively preparing for **industry roles in computational genomics, machine learning for biology, and regulatory sequence modeling** beginning in 2026.
